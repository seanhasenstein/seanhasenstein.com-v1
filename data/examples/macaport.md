### Description

Macaport approached me looking for an e-commerce platform for their screen printing business. After discussing their needs I built an e-commerce Next.js app and a dashboard to manage the API's for inventory, stores, products, and orders.

The website gives Macaport's clients the ability to sell screen printed products to their groups, businesses, teams, organizations, etc.

#### Store Features

- Persistent carts.
- Inventory management.
- Customizable product add-ons (names, numbers, etc).
- Customizable shipping options.
- Stripe for transactions.
- Mailgun for transactional emails.
