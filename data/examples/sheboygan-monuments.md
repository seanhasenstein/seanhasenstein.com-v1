### Description

I have been working with Sheboygan Monuments since 2020. I designed and developed their current website in 2021 with Gatsby. It's hosted on Netlify and uses their serverless functions.

The purpose of this website is for informational and marketing purposes. The website includes a testimonial slider, an accordion that displays their services, image galleries for examples of their work, and a contact form.
