### Description

I have been working with Van Gemert Memorials since 2018. I designed and developed their current website in 2021 with Gatsby. It's hosted on Netlify and uses their serverless functions.

The purpose of this website is for informational and marketing purposes. The website includes a testimonial slider, image galleries for examples of their work, a FAQ accordion, and a contact form.
