### Description

I have been working with Zabel Monuments since 2016. I designed and developed their current website in 2021 with Gatsby. It's hosted on Netlify and uses their serverless functions.

The purpose of this website is for informational and marketing purposes for their 4 store locations. The website includes a testimonial slider, image galleries, a FAQ accordion, and a dynamic contact form that allows users to select the store location that they would like to contact.
