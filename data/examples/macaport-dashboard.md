### Description

Macaport approached me for an e-commerce platform for their screen printing business. After discussing their needs I built them an e-commerce website and also this dashboard.

The dashboard gives Macaport the ability to manage their API's for inventory, stores, products, and orders that are used on the e-commerce website.

#### Store Features

- “Passwordless” email authentication.
- An API that handles data for inventory, stores, products, and orders.
- Data filtering, sorting, exporting.
- Printable order invoices.
