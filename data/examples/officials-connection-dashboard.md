### Description

I created this dashboard to manage API's for camp registrations and camp scheduling. The dashboard data is connected to an e-commerce platform that I also built for Officials Connection.

#### Store Features

- “Passwordless” authentication.
- An API that handles registrations and schedules.
- Data filtering, sorting, and exporting.
- Printable registration invoices.
