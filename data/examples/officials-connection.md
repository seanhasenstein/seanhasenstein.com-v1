### Description

I have been working with the the Wisconsin Basketball Yearbook Officials Camps since 2015. We use officialsconnection.org for marketing and registration.

Along with the website I also created a dashboard that manages their registration and scheduling API's. And finally I created a Node.js server that uses Mailgun for email marketing campaigns.

#### Store Features

- A customized registration process.
- Stripe for transactions.
- Mailgun for marketing and transactional emails.
