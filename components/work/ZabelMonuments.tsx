        I have been working with Zabel Monuments since 2016. I designed and
        developed their current website in 2021 with Gatsby. It's hosted on

        The purpose of this website is for informational and marketing purposes
        for their 4 store locations. The website includes a testimonial slider,
        image galleries, a FAQ accordion, and a dynamic contact form that allows
        users to select the store location that they would like to contact.
